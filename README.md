<h2>My first small Kotlin project!</h2>

- It's a small calculator where I tried to leverage various features of the language.

<ul>
  <li>Created function that does the stuff</li>
  <li>Custom Errors via Classes</li>
  <li>Used various Kotlin Data Structures and methods available to them</li>
</ul>

- Converted to `jar` file in **out** folder that is ready to be used in CLI
